This folder contains all the reference data we need for scDIAGRAM.
Here we use the reference genome mm10 for mouse and hg19 for human.
You can replace with your own choice of versions for the reference genome.
The descriptions for each file are listed below:

- centro_pos.txt:               This file contains the centromere positions (the start and end) of the hg19 genome,
                                binned at 100kb.
- hg19.autosomal.chrom.sizes    This file lists the length for each autochromosome, in the hg19 genome.
- hg19.CpG.100000.txt           This file lists the CpG density of each loci on the autochromosomes, computed from the hg19 genome,
                                binned at 100kb.
- mm10_chr_size.txt             This file lists the length for each autochromosome, in the mm10 genome.
- mm10.CpG.100000.txt           This file lists the CpG density of each loci on the autochromosomes, computed from the mm10 genome,
                                binned at 100kb.
- mm10.CpG.1000000.txt          This file lists the CpG density of each loci on the autochromosomes, computed from the mm10 genome,
                                binned at 1Mb.
